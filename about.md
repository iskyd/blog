Other than saving Gotham at night I'm a Software Engineer in love with Data Science, Maths, Space, Bitcoin and Startups. Currently I'm Backend Engineer at Conio inc, an italian scale-up that is chainging the Bitcoin's world. Previously I was Lead AI Engineer at nCore HR.

Here you can read about Julia, Docker, Kubernetes, Bitcoin and lot more.
